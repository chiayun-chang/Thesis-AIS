## Abstract

This MSc thesis aims to develop a workflow analyzing inland vessel traffic anomalies during low water levels by using historical automated identification system (AIS) data. Low water level impacts inland waterway transports because cargo ships must carry less weight in order to stay safe and afloat. The consequences are the same amount of freight needs more trips to be transported comparing to normal water level times, and more trips lead to busier waterways and higher freight rates. Many inland transportation reports and news articles have discussed the impacts of low water levels on inland shipping, but not many studies have used AIS data and water level data to analyze the relationship. Thus, this research tries to fill in this gap in two aspects: validate the market observations and detect vessel interaction anomalies.
